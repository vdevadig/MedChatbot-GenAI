      "Answer:  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which are the airways that lead to the lungs. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection and can be accompanied by a dry cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is a long-term condition that can be caused by exposure to pollutants such as cigarette smoke or dust. It can lead to persistent coughing and difficulty breathing. In some cases, bronchitis can also cause complications such asions such as such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asations such asions such asions such as-lications such asions such asions such as such as -lications such as mentioned inations such asionations such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asions such asinsations such asions such asions such asions such as.\n"
